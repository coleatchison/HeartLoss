# HeartLoss
 A simple 1-bit platformer where the objective is to collect all the hearts as fast as possible!

## Engine
This game is made in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). This is the first game I've made with this engine, so I wanted to start with a simple platformer.

## Installation

As these are the raw game files, you'll have to open the cloned project in Godot and run it from within the engine. This does not come with a distributed copy.
